[Z3] Q.E.D.

[SBV] tests/T19.hs:15:1 Proving "g", using Z3.
[Z3] Falsifiable. Counter-example:
  s_1 = Char_0 :: Char
  s_2 = Char_0 :: Char
  s_3 = Char_0 :: Char
  s_4 = Char_0 :: Char
  s_5 = Char_0 :: Char
  s_6 = Char_0 :: Char
[SBV] Counter-example might be bogus due to uninterpreted constants:
  [<wired into compiler>] C# :: Char# %1 -> Char
