[Z3] Q.E.D.

[SBV] tests/T19.hs:15:1 Proving "g", using Z3.
[Z3] Falsifiable. Counter-example:
  s_1 = sbvChar!val!0 :: sbvChar
  s_2 = sbvChar!val!0 :: sbvChar
  s_3 = sbvChar!val!0 :: sbvChar
  s_4 = sbvChar!val!0 :: sbvChar
  s_5 = sbvChar!val!0 :: sbvChar
  s_6 = sbvChar!val!0 :: sbvChar
[SBV] Counter-example might be bogus due to uninterpreted constants:
  [<wired into compiler>] C# :: Char# %1 -> Char
