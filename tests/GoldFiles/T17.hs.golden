[SBV] tests/T17.hs:14:1 Proving "f", using Z3.
[Z3] Falsifiable. Counter-example:
  x = 0 :: Int64

  g :: Int64 -> Int64
  g 1 = 0 
  g _ = -1
[SBV] Counter-example might be bogus due to uninterpreted constant:
  [tests/T17.hs:9:1] g :: Int -> Int
[SBV] Failed. (Use option 'IgnoreFailure' to continue.)
